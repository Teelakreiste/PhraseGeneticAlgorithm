# PhraseGeneticAlgorithm
The Genetic Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm used for optimization problems. It mimics the process of natural selection and genetic inheritance to find the best solution to a problem. In this implementation, we will use the Genetic Algorithm to evolve a population of individuals to match a target phrase.
